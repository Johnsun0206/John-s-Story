Brain is a student at University of Wisconsin-Madison. He is a big fan of CSGO. He's already played for 2000 hours. 

Brain was not satisfied with this. He needed at least 2000 more hours to be able to qualify for his local esports team.

Sacrificing his grades, Brian started to play CS:GO for over four hours a day.
He went to the UW-Madison student clubs page and joined the Madison e-Sports club.

There were tryouts and Brain made the CS:GO team. He became one of the best players on his team. The only thing was that his grades were starting to hold him back.

But who cares about grades when Brain became a professional level CSGO player. He was so good, that he won a million dollar tournament and became really famous.
Sadly, the IRS came knocking on his door and lost everything to taxes.
